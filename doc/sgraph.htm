<h3><a NAME="Introduction"></a><b>Introduction</b></h3>

<p>This is a set of 32-bit Delphi components and classes for 2D plot. It is relatively
simple. It is more gauge then presentation element. The main features are: 

<ul>
  <li>Two horizontal and two vertical axis.</li>
  <li>Auto minimum and maximum of the axis.</li>
  <li>Swap of Min and Max axis positions. </li>
  <li>MoveMinMax method to provide smooth scrolling of axis ticks.</li>
  <li>Panning and Zoom by mouse.</li>
  <li>Buffered screen paint, can be off.</li>
  <li>Copy to clipboard as DIB or as Metafile.</li>
  <li>Custom Data Series.</li>
  <li>DrawPlot method to replicate plot image </li>
  <li>OnDrawField OnDrawEnd events</li>
</ul>

<p>The main component is Tsp_XYPlot. It holds four Tsp_Axis and controls Data Series. The
Tsp_XYPlot and Tsp_Axis provide base plot functionality like auto scale, zoom and pan and
so on. The Data Series must be derived from Tsp_DataSeries and implements data storage and
how data are painted on the plot canvas. An example of these components are Tsp_XYLine and
Tsp_SpectrLines. Plot also can has and controls components inherited from Tsp_PlotMarker.
Plot marker draws something on the plot using axis coordinate system. An example of these
components are Tsp_LineMarker and Tsp_ImageMarker.</p>

</p>

<p><u>subdirectory</u> <b>\doc </b>contains Sgraph documentation <br>
here this file your read, I also encourage you to read <a href="notes.htm">notes</a>.</p>

<p><u>subdirectory</u> <b>\help5 </b>contains help files:<br>
<b>sgr_def.hlp</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Components help file <br>
<b>sgr_def.cnt</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Help context file<br>
<b>sgr_defi.cnt</b>&nbsp; Help context file to <a href="#Include CNT">make link</a> from

<p><u>subdirectory</u> <b>demo</b> contains files of demo program. </p>

<p><a href="sgraph_demo.gif"><img src="sgraph_demo_sml.gif" alt="sgraph_demo.gif (9308 bytes)" WIDTH="100" HEIGHT="60"></a></p>

<p><font color="#800000">I recommend to see demo program, there are some extensions of
SGraph (<a href="notes.htm#Print">print</a>, legend).</font></p>

<h3><a NAME="Install components"></a>Install components </h3>

<h4>Extract files. </h4>

<p>You have to use unzip program which preserve long file name or you must correct names
manually if they was cut. Place to one directory all SGraph <a href="#source files">source
files</a>. If you want place components on other then &quot;Sample&quot; tab, then edit
sgr_reg.pas.</p>


<h4>Delphi 5</h4>
You can use <strong>sgr5.dpk</strong> packet file.
You also can add Sgraph components to dclusr50 package preinstaled in the Delphi. Select in the menu Component than 
Install component... and enter way to the sgr_reg.pas in the Unit file name.

<h4>Install Help files</h4>

<p><a name="Include CNT">I also recommend</a> to add to the Include section<font color="#800000"> </font>of the DELPHI3.CNT file this line <br>
<tt><font color="#800000">:Include sgr_defi.cnt</font></tt> <br>
I do not check installation for <strong>Delphi 4</strong>, but I find that there are DELPHI4.CFG and
DELPHI4.CNT files in \HELP directory are same as ones in Delphi 3.</p>

<p>To install help file for <strong>Delphi 5</strong>
run Delphi (as Administrator) and select in the menu Help and than Customize... It opens Open Help tool. 
To add sgraph help to the context-sensitive Help search range choose the Contents tab and select Edit|Add and select sgr_def.toc file to add.<br> 
add sgr_def.hlp to Index and Link. See more details in the tool help i.e. in the tool menus select Help and read.

<p>After installation I recommend to compile demo program to check components<font SIZE="-1">.</font> It also demonstrates some possibilities of SGraph and contains some
extensions like print dialog. </p>

<h3><a NAME="Update"></a>Replace old version of Sgraph</h3>

<p>If you already have old version SGraph you need copy all SGraph new source files
(*.pas, *.res,&nbsp; and *.dcr) over old version files (of course you can first backup old
files). Then open packet file where you included old SGraph file and recompile this
packet. Don't forget to replace sgr_def.hlp and sgr_def.cnt files. Notice, demo program
was modified, try to compile it to check that all was reinstalled properly.</p>

<h3><a NAME="Start"></a>How to start</h3>

<p>Place the plot component and data series component on the form, set Plot property of
data series to link it with plot. Play with visual properties of plot and series, while
select properties press &lt;F1&gt; key to see help file topic. Please set true-type font
to Font property of plot if you want have vertical axis captions. There is also some <a href="notes.htm">notes</a> of using SGraph.</p>


<h3><a NAME="Aknowledgements"></a>Aknowledgements </h3>

<p>I wish to thank to Peter Kravtsov for comprehensive advise to add DataTime format of
ticks label and Mauro J. Cavalcanti for the useful discussions and suggestions. A would
like to thank to all who wrote me good words about SGraph. </p>

<p>My best wishes. </p>
