# SGraph 

Set of 32 bit Delphi components and classes for 2D plot. Has been used for Delphi 5 (1999). It is relatively simple. It is more gauge then presentation element. For more details see sgraph.htm in \doc subdirectory or sgraph.hlp or index.htm in helps subdirectories. Subdirectory demo\ contains demo program source and compiled win32 exe files. 
It can be used in Delphi 7 (sgr7.dpk/sgr7.res and pay attention to unit which contains Variant for sgr_data.pas). It also can be ported to the Delphi 2010 and Lazarus IDE v.2 (I have checked that).
